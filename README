SUGARSCAPE

Python implementation of the Sugarscape agent-based computational model introduced in Growing Artificial Societies (1996) by Epstein and Axtell.

Inspired by previous work from Herve Lange (https://github.com/langerv/sugarscape) and Joshua Palicka (https://github.com/joshuapalicka/sugarscape).

Requirements:
Bash
Python 3
TkInter

Usage:
python sugarscape.py

Makefile Options:
make clean
    Clean up working files and logs created by the software.
    Note: will remove any JSON files created by the other make options.

make data
    Run a number of random seeds comparing implemented decision models to the baseline greedy decisionmaking.
    Note: results will be saved in the data subdirectory.

make plots
    Generate graph plots from any JSON files in the data subdirectory.
    Note: plots are dependent on a dataset existing and will create it if necessary.

make setup
    Change preconfigured settings for the simulation, data collection, and datset plotting.
    Note: changed settings may alter files in-place if editing the simulation configuration or Makefile options.

make test
    Run the simulation using the default config.json file and storing a local log in the log.json file.
