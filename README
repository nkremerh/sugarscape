SUGARSCAPE

Python implementation of the Sugarscape agent-based computational model introduced in Growing Artificial Societies (1996) by Epstein and Axtell.

Inspired by previous work from Herve Lange (https://github.com/langerv/sugarscape) and Joshua Palicka (https://github.com/joshuapalicka/sugarscape).

Optional Dependencies:
Matplotlib
TkInter

Usage:
python sugarscape.py

Makefile Options:
make clean
    Clean up working files and logs created by the software.
    Note: This will remove any JSON files created by the other make options.

make data
    Run a number of random seeds comparing selected decision models.
    Note: Results will be saved in the data subdirectory.
